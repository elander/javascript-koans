<p>Based on Edgecase&#39;s fantastic 
<a href="http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans">Ruby koans</a>, the goal of the
Javascript koans is to teach you Javascript programming through
testing.</p>
<p>When you first run the koans, you&#39;ll be presented with a runtime error and a
stack trace indicating where the error occurred. Your goal is to make the
error go away. As you fix each error, you should learn something about the
Javascript language and functional programming in general.</p>
<p>Your journey towards Javascript enlightenment starts in the koans/AboutExpects.js file. These
koans will be very simple, so don&#39;t overthink them! As you progress through
more koans, more and more Javascript syntax will be introduced which will allow
you to solve more complicated problems and use more advanced techniques.</p>
<h2 id="running-the-koans">Running the Koans</h2>
<p>Simply navigate to the Javascript Koans folder using a file browser, and
double click on KoansRunnner.html. </p>
<p>Any browser will do, but for the best results Firefox or Chrome is
recommended. More stack trace information shows up for javascript on these
browsers.</p>
<p>The first error will be in koans/AboutExpects.js. Fix the first test and
refresh the browser. Rinse and repeat until all tests turn green.</p>
<p>The test runner used is <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> with a customized report viewer.</p>
